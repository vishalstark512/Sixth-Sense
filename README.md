# Sixth-Sense

This project contains two files one is to draw the path moved by an object i.e. draw.py
and second one is for the virtual mouse all you need to do is put on the color caps on your 
hands and you are ready with a new kind of mouse use yellow for clicking and orange for dragging mouse.
I have not setup for scrolling it can be done easily you just need to add another if in the code where if part
of left and right click are defined.



NOTE- doing this on the laptop webcam is not appreciated, so I used another webcam LOGITECH c310
and try not to use shiny surfaces for the markers(color caps)
